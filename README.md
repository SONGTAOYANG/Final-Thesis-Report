# Final-Thesis-Reportï¼šSEDATION MONITORING IN CLINICAL CARE
## Project Structure

- `Feature_Extraction.m`: Extracts relevant features from OMT signals
- `Burst_Detection_v2.m`: Detects signal bursts based on energy changes
- `Total_Energy_Radio_Relation.m`: Demonstrates the correlation between total energy and changes in different frequency components
- `Wavelet_Denoise_MDF.m`: Applies wavelet denoising to the Mean Dominant Frequency (MDF) and plots its variation over time
